# mpg - more modern postgres to the gallon

Eases interoperability between clojure/java datatypes and postgres
datatypes. No more boilerplate!

Handles the following:

- DATE <-> java.time.LocalDate
- TIMESTAMP <-> java.time.Instant
- TIMESTAMPTZ <-> java.time.ZonedDateTime
- JSON/JSONB <-> clojure map/vector
- ARRAY <-> clojure vector
- HSTORE <-> clojure map*

* HSTORE is not as rich as JSON, everything in the map becomes a string

## Usage

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/mpg.svg)](https://clojars.org/mpg)

Just require the `mpg.core` namespace and call `patch`

```clojure
(ns whatever.db
    (require [clojure.java.jdbc :as j]
             [mpg.core :as mpg]]))
      "
(mpg/patch) ;; take the default settings
(mpg/patch {:default-map :hstore}) ;; custom settings are merged with the defaults
;; valid settings:
    :data        - boolean, default true. auto-map maps and vectors?
    :datetime    - boolean, default true. auto-map java.time.{LocalDate, ZonedDateTime} ?
    :default-map - keyword. one of :json, :hstore. Default :json
```

## Limitations

The current clojure.java.jdbc interface imposes some limitations on us.

1. You must use clojure.java.jdbc or a library that does to benefit from this library
2. When not using prepared statements, we cannot save a vector as an array type (we therefore use json)
3. When not using prepared statements, you must choose between storing maps as json or hstore (default: json)
4. We assume you are using the postgres default, UTC and that your timestamp (i.e. without time zone) columns are in UTC

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements welcome, just open an issue! :)

If this library should do something, and it doesn't currently do it, please fork
and open a pull request. All reasonable contributions will be accepted.

## Acknowledgements

This library was originally extracted from luminus boilerplate which
hails from code floating around the internet
generally. [James Laver](https://github.com/jjl) then contributed a
new API and java.time support.
