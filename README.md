# jdbc-pg-sanity

Sane defaults for working with clojure.jdbc and postgresql.
No more boilerplate.

Handles the following:

- dates to java.util.Date
- json and jsonb to clojure maps
- postgres arrays to clojure vectors


## Usage

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/jdbc-pg-sanity.svg)](https://clojars.org/jdbc-pg-sanity)

Just require the `jdbc-pg-sanity.core` namespace:

```clojure
(ns whatever.db
    (require [clojure.java.jdbc :as j]
             jdbc-pg-sanity.core))

;; do your postgres thing here
```

since time immemorial.
